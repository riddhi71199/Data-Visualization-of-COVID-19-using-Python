# Data-Visualization-of-COVID-19-using-Python
With the rapid spread in the novel corona-virus across countries, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and several countries have published latest results on the impact of COVID-19 over the past few months. I have been going through many sources and articles to understand the fatality trend and I was excited to come across this data source and decided to see some visualization on the same. The aim here is to understand how visualization helps to derive informative insights from data sources.

The data is been collected from the wesite https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19. The csv files of confirmed cases, death cases, recovered cases and latest data is been collected in the form of different csv files and are imported using pandas. Certain pre-processing of data is done on the collected data. This data is then visualized against different parametes/variables among themselves to get a better idea about the number of death rates or recovery rates and much more.

The link for implementation of this data visualization is given below: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gCFiEcAsBINS1nYYntP11HTxhUXJY0Jn?usp=sharing
